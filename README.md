# OOPS_clear_concepts as I see......
A very easy way to understand oop concepts through real_world examples by me!
<br>
1. Constructor intro - for learning about usage of constructor and static,non-static keywords.
2. Abstraction - for learning whats an abstract class and interface/difference also.
3. Inheritance.java - has all basic concepts of java that involves inheritance.
4. Encapsulation.java - a easy way to understand what binding of data and functions mean.
5. Polymorphism.java - ever heard of strategy design pattern -- yeah how a function behaves differently for different
                       objects. Wont bore you much... read happily :)
